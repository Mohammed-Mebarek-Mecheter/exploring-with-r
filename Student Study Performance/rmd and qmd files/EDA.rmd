# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Univariate Analysis
```{r}
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("../data/study_performance_cleaned.csv")
head(data)
```
### Explore distributions of numerical variables
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Histogram for math scores
ggplot(data, aes(x = math_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Math Scores",
       x = "Math Score",
       y = "Frequency")

# Histogram for reading scores
ggplot(data, aes(x = reading_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Reading Scores",
       x = "Reading Score",
       y = "Frequency")

# Histogram for writing scores
ggplot(data, aes(x = writing_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Writing Scores",
       x = "Writing Score",
       y = "Frequency")
```
### Create bar plots for categorical variables
```{r}
# Bar plot for gender
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Gender",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Count")

# Bar plot for race/ethnicity
ggplot(data, aes(x = race_ethnicity)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightgreen") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Race/Ethnicity",
       x = "Race/Ethnicity",
       y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Bar plot for parental level of education
ggplot(data, aes(x = parental_level_of_education)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightcoral") +

       x = "Parental Level of Education",
       y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Bar plot for lunch
ggplot(data, aes(x = lunch)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Lunch",
       x = "Lunch",
       y = "Count")

# Bar plot for test preparation course
ggplot(data, aes(x = test_preparation_course)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightpink") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Test Preparation Course",
       x = "Test Preparation Course",

```
## Bivariate Analysis
### Scatter plots for numerical variables
```{r}

       y = "Reading Score")

# Math score vs writing score
ggplot(data, aes(x = math_score, y = writing_score)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkorange") +
  labs(title = "Math Score vs Writing Score",
       x = "Math Score",
       y = "Writing Score")

# Reading score vs writing score
ggplot(data, aes(x = reading_score, y = writing_score)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "Reading Score vs Writing Score",
       x = "Reading Score",
       y = "Writing Score")
```
